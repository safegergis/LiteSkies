# LiteSkies: Weather App ‚òÄÔ∏èüåßÔ∏è

LiteSkies is a sleek and intuitive weather application designed to provide you with up-to-date weather conditions at a glance. I developed this application to deepen my experience with building modern web apps, particularly focusing on interfacing with external APIs such as OpenWeatherAPI. The journey of creating LiteSkies allowed me to hone my skills, tackle challenges, and implement real-world solutions.
